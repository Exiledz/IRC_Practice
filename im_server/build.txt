Building in linux:
1. Install boost 1.57.0 -- See http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_57_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html. Make sure to build binaries as they will be needed. Also build again with link=static option for static binaries if needed.

2. For ease, move include files to /usr/include/ and binaries to /usr/lib/

3. Compile with the following command:
      g++ server.cpp tcp_connection.cpp tcp_server.cpp -lboost_system -lboost_date_time -lpthread -o server
